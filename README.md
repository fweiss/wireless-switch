# Wireless Switch

A simple DIY wireless switch

## Usage

Current usage is a bit funky. Eventually, it should be streamlined.

- From your wireless device, connect to "ESP8266 Thing XXXX"
- The password is "sparkfun"
- Open a browser on http://192.168.41.1

The LED On and LED Off buttons are reversed.

The Read Analog does nothing.
